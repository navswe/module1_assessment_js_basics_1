// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

//Correct order of Software Development Lifecycle steps are:
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "In this step, the requirements for the new system/product are determined. The team will define system requirements, evaluate alternatives or existing prototypes, and may need to perform research on the end-user needs."
const design = "Developers will outline the system details such as user interfaces, system interfaces, network requirements, databases, etc. "
const implementation = "Also called the Development stage, in this step the developers will write code and build the system based on the outlined specifications and design documents from the previous steps."
const testingAndIntegration = "In in step, the develops will test the system/product for bugs to improve the product quality and the end-user experience. After testing, parts of the system will be integrated into a primary source code, tested again as a integrated system, and deployed for use."
const maintain = "Finally the developers must also  keep maintaining the software and resolve bugs reported by the end-users."
